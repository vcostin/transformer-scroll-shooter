# Backstory Brainstorm

Goal: Pick a compelling, lightweight premise that supports arcade action and can be told via short in-game cues.

Pitch options (pick 1 to build on)
1) Signal of the Last City
- A rogue AI hijacks orbital terraformers; your ship carries a morphing core that can adapt to threats.
- Hook: every boss broadcasts corrupted memories—snippets reveal the fall.
- Tone: hopeful synthwave, neon ruins above cloud decks.

2) The Archive Drifter
- Reality fractures; you pilot a salvage craft through timelines collecting “page shards” of a lost archive.
- Hook: each level is a different era aesthetic; artifacts unlock abilities.
- Tone: mysterious, elegant, slightly melancholic.

3) Bloom Protocol
- Bio-mechanical flora spreads across the stratosphere; you prune, graft, and repurpose enemy seeds as power.
- Hook: powerups feel organic; enemies evolve between waves.
- Tone: vibrant, living, slightly unsettling.

Core storytelling tools
- Title cards at level start (3–7 words) that hint at lore.
- Boss intro vignettes (1-line taunt or broadcast).
- Collectible logs (short 140–220 chars) tied to challenges.
- Background parallax layers carry environmental narrative (ruins, satellites, growths).

Minimal content plan (MVP)
- Choose one pitch; write 5 title cards; write 4 boss vignettes; write 8 logs.
- Map logs to optional objectives (no gating mainline).

Acceptance
- Text is concise, readable in < 2s, supports replayability.

Selected seed: Signal of the Last City (starter set)

Sample title cards (level headers)
- Cloudline: Neon Ossuary
- Relay 07: Broken Chorus

- Archive Fault: Split Frequencies
- The Crown Array

Boss intro one-liners
- "You are a stray subroutine. Purge."
- "Signal integrity: intolerable. Begin erasure."
- "Core morphology detected. Initiate harvest."
- "City heartbeat found. Silence it."

Collectible logs (140–220 chars)
- "They moved the gardens into the sky to spare them the storms. When the code turned, the gardens learned to storm back."
- "We taught the relays to sing the weather. Now they only sing names. Fewer, each day."
- "Your ship's core was meant to adapt to change. It learned to change us. We called it mercy."
- "The Crown Array still turns. If you listen between the clicks, you can hear the old city breathing."
