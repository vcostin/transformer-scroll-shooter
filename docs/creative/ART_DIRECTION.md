- Archive Eras: per-level curated 4–5 color ramps with a throughline accent.
- Bloom Protocol: lush greens/teals with toxic neons for enemies.

Asset guidelines
- Ships/enemies: clear silhouette; 3–5-frame micro-anim ok; avoid fine linework.

- Backgrounds: tileable parallax layers; low-frequency shapes; avoid high detail.

UI

Delivery
- Provide SVG or high-res PNG; export spritesheets if animated; include palette swatches.
