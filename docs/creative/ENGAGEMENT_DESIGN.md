# Engagement & Game Feel

Pillars
- Clarity: readable threats, consistent color language.
- Response: punchy SFX, hit flashes, screen shake (tiny), slow-mo on big kills.
- Goals: short-term objectives and streak systems.

Systems to prototype
- Combo Multiplier: increases with hits without damage; decays on timer; reward score + cosmetic intensity.
- Risk/Reward Powerups: hold to charge pickup for stronger effect but risk damage.
- Micro-Challenges: per-level rotating objectives (e.g., no damage for 20s, snipe 5 drones).
- Momentum Meter: fills from movement + near-miss; triggers brief overdrive.

Feedback kits
- Hit flash on enemies (1â€“2 frames), particle burst, brief pitch-shift on SFX.
- Player damage: invuln blink, muffled SFX, slight desaturation.

Retention hooks
- Unlockable ship skins via logs/challenges.
- Daily remix seed for waves.

MVP acceptance
- One working combo + one micro-challenge + satisfying hit feedback.
