# The Relay Warden: A Legend Born from Code

## Character Overview

The **Relay Warden** stands as the most dramatically self-aware entity in the Transformer Scroll Shooter universe. Unlike other bosses who accept their generic classifications, the Relay Warden possesses a fierce sense of identity and refuses to be diminished by simple categorization.

## Origin Story: From Bug to Boss

### The Genesis (GitHub Actions Incident)
The Relay Warden's legendary personality was born from an unexpected source: a failing unit test. On August 22, 2025, during the implementation of Issue #54, the universe witnessed a moment that would define gaming history.
