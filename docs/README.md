# Event-Driven Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the game's **completed** event-driven architecture transformation. The project has successfully migrated from direct object manipulation to a modern, pure event-driven system.

> **✅ Status**: Implementation complete! All architecture goals achieved with zero legacy dependencies.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

### 🏗️ [Implementation Reference](./IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md)
Complete technical specifications and examples of the implemented architecture.

### 📊 [Performance Guide](./PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md)
Performance optimizations and benchmarking results for the event-driven systems.

### � [State Management](./STATE_MANAGEMENT.md)
Complete guide to the StateManager system with examples and best practices.

### ⚡ [Side Effects Architecture](./SIDE_EFFECTS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
Documentation of the EffectManager system for coordinating side effects.

## 🎯 Architecture Highlights

### ✅ **Completed Systems**
- **EventDispatcher**: High-performance event routing with wildcard pattern matching
- **StateManager**: Immutable state management with deep cloning and history
- **EffectManager**: Pattern-based side effects coordination
- **Entity System**: Pure event-driven entity lifecycle management
- **700+ Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage with zero legacy dependencies

### � **Performance Achievements**
- **Optimized Event Matching**: O(1) wildcard pattern caching
- **Memory Efficient**: Circular buffer event history management
- **Native API Integration**: Modern browser optimizations with backward compatibility
- **Zero Legacy Overhead**: Clean architecture without compatibility bridges

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### 🔧 **For Developers**
1. **Review [State Management](./STATE_MANAGEMENT.md)** for StateManager patterns
2. **Check [Side Effects Architecture](./SIDE_EFFECTS_ARCHITECTURE.md)** for EffectManager usage
3. **Reference [Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md)** for technical details
4. **Study [Performance Guide](./PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md)** for optimization patterns

### 📈 **Architecture Benefits**
- **Predictable State Flow**: All state changes through StateManager events
- **Decoupled Components**: Event-driven communication between systems
- **High Performance**: Optimized event matching and state management
- **100% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing with zero legacy dependencies
- **Modern Standards**: Pure ES modules with no backward compatibility overhead
