## 📊 Project Overview

### Total Effort Estimation
- **Phase 1**: 7-10 days
- **Phase 2**: 12-18 days
- **Phase 3**: 12-16 days
- **Total**: 31-44 days (~6-9 weeks)

### Dependencies Chain
```
Phase 1:
#13 (EventDispatcher) → #14 (StateManager) → #15 (Game Loop)
                            ↓
Phase 2:
#16 (Player) ← #13, #14, #15
#17 (Enemy) ← #13, #14, #15
#18 (UI) ← #13, #14
#19 (Performance) ← #13-18

Phase 3:
#20 (Web Workers) ← #13-19
#21 (Save/Load) ← #14
#22 (Replay) ← #13
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start with Issue #13**: Core Event System implementation
2. **Follow the dependency chain**: Each issue builds on previous ones
3. **Regular check-ins**: Review progress after each epic completion
4. **Testing throughout**: Maintain >90% coverage as we refactor
5. **Performance monitoring**: Ensure 60fps maintained during refactor
