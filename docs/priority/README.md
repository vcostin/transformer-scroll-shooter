# 🎯 Priority Documentation - Entity-State Architecture Era

> **Clean Centralized State with Stateless Entities - The New Foundation**

## 📋 Current Status (August 26, 2025)

✅ **StateManager Simplified**: Clean entity-state architecture implemented  
🎮 **Game Working**: Core game functionality operational with new architecture  
🏗️ **Architecture Revolution**: Centralized state + stateless entities pattern established  
📊 **Foundation Ready**: Ready for entity refactoring and advanced patterns

## 🗂️ Priority Documents

### 1. [ENTITY_STATE_ARCHITECTURE.md](./ENTITY_STATE_ARCHITECTURE.md) ⭐ **NEW CORE DOCUMENT**
**The definitive guide to our architectural philosophy**
- Single source of truth state management
- Stateless entity components (React-like for games)
- Event-driven coordination patterns
- Implementation guidelines and best practices
- Migration roadmap and success metrics

### 2. [PHASE_5_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](./PHASE_5_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
**Updated roadmap for entity architecture migration**
- **Phase 5a**: Entity refactoring (Player, Enemies, Bullets)
- **Phase 5b**: Advanced entity patterns and composition  
- **Phase 5c**: Performance optimization and tooling
- Updated timeline for new architecture

### 3. [NEXT_PRIORITIES.md](./NEXT_PRIORITIES.md)
**Entity-focused immediate actions**
- Entity conversion priorities
- StateManager integration points
- Architecture compliance checklist

### 4. [FUNCTIONAL_GUIDELINES.md](./FUNCTIONAL_GUIDELINES.md)
**Updated for entity-state patterns**
- Stateless entity component patterns
- State access conventions
- Event coordination best practices

## 🎯 Quick Start for Entity Architecture

1. **Read**: `ENTITY_STATE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete philosophy
2. **Start with**: Player entity conversion to stateless component
3. **Follow**: Entity patterns and state access guidelines
4. **Track**: Architecture compliance and performance

## 📊 Architecture Success Metrics

- ✅ **Entities are stateless** - no internal state, only pure functions
- ✅ **Single source of truth** - all state in StateManager
- ✅ **Event-driven coordination** - entities communicate through state changes
- ✅ **Clean separation** - graphics, logic, and state clearly separated
- ✅ **Performance maintained** - efficient state updates and rendering

## 🎮 Known Issues

- Options Menu behavior - to be addressed during entity refactoring phase
