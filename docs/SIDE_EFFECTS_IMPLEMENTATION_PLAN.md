# Side Effects Architecture Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for introducing a Redux-Saga inspired side effects architecture to the Transformer Scroll Shooter game. The goal is to separate business logic from side effects, improving code maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**GitHub Issue**: [#32 - Side Effects Architecture - Foundation Implementation](https://github.com/vcostin/transformer-scroll-shooter/issues/32)

**Objectives**:
- Implement core side effects system
- Create basic effect context operations
- Integrate with existing event system
- Establish testing patterns

**Key Deliverables**:
- `EffectManager` class for coordinating side effects
- `EffectContext` class with `call`, `fork`, and `put` operations
- Integration with existing `EventDispatcher`
- Basic effect registration system
- Comprehensive test suite

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Can register effects for events
- ✅ Effects execute when events fire
- ✅ Basic async operations work
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met

### ⚡ Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2)
**GitHub Issue**: [#33 - Side Effects Architecture - Advanced Control Flow](https://github.com/vcostin/transformer-scroll-shooter/issues/33)

**Objectives**:
- Implement advanced control flow operations
- Add pattern matching for flexible effect registration
- Implement effect cancellation and error handling
- Create complex async flow examples

**Key Deliverables**:
- Advanced `EffectContext` operations (`take`, `select`, `delay`, `race`, `all`)
- Pattern matching system (glob, wildcard, regex)
- Effect cancellation and timeout handling
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Complex flow examples and documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All advanced operations working
- ✅ Pattern matching flexible and performant
- ✅ Effect cancellation working reliably
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes
- ✅ Complex async flows possible

### 🔄 Phase 3: Migration (Week 3-4)
**GitHub Issue**: [#34 - Side Effects Migration - Entity Refactoring](https://github.com/vcostin/transformer-scroll-shooter/issues/34)

**Objectives**:
- Systematically migrate existing side effects
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update tests to use new architecture
- Ensure no performance regression

**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete audit of existing side effects
- Migration of all identified side effects
- Updated test suite
- Performance validation
- Documentation updates

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All side effects migrated to new architecture
- ✅ Entities contain only pure business logic
- ✅ All tests updated and passing
- ✅ No performance regression
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

tests/systems/effect-*.test.js    // New - Test suites
```

examples/effects/                 // New - Usage examples
```

### Week 3-4: Migration
```javascript
// Entity refactoring
src/entities/player.js            // Refactored - Pure business logic
src/entities/enemies/enemy.js     // Refactored - Pure business logic
src/ui/                           // Refactored - Side effects extracted
src/game/                         // Refactored - Side effects extracted
src/effects/                      // New - Effect handlers
tests/                            // Updated - All test files
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Entity Logic**: Test business logic without side effects
- **Effect Handlers**: Test side effects in isolation
- **Effect Context**: Test all operations independently
- **Pattern Matching**: Test flexible event matching

### Integration Testing
- **Event Flow**: Test event-to-effect execution
- **Multiple Effects**: Test multiple effects per event
- **Error Handling**: Test error propagation and recovery
- **Performance**: Test execution speed and memory usage

### Migration Testing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing code works
- **Feature Parity**: All features work the same way
- **Performance**: No degradation in game performance
- **Regression**: All existing tests still pass

## 📊 Success Metrics

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Before (Current State)
```javascript
// Mixed concerns - hard to test
class Player {
  takeDamage(damage) {
    this.health -= damage;           // Business logic
    this.saveToLocalStorage();       // Side effect
    this.updateHealthBar();          // Side effect
    this.playSound('hurt');          // Side effect
    this.trackAnalytics('damage');   // Side effect
  }
}
```

### After (Target State)
```javascript
// Pure business logic - easy to test
class Player {
  takeDamage(damage) {
    this.health -= damage;
    this.emit('player:damaged', { 
      player: this, 
      damage, 
      previousHealth: this.health + damage 
    });
  }
}

// Side effects in dedicated system
effectManager.effect('player:damaged', async (action, effects) => {
  const { player, damage } = action.payload;
  
  // Async operations with proper error handling
  await effects.call(saveToLocalStorage, player);
  await effects.call(updateHealthBar, player.health);
  
  // Fire and forget operations
  effects.fork(playSound, 'hurt');
  effects.fork(trackAnalytics, 'player_damaged', { damage });
  
  // Conditional flows
  if (player.health <= 0) {
    await effects.call(showGameOver);
    effects.put({ type: 'game:over', payload: { player } });
  }
});
```
