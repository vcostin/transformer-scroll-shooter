## üöÄ Development Strategy Recommendation

### **Primary Focus: Game Features Over Modularization**

**Rationale:**
- Current codebase is clean and manageable (8 files, ~1200 lines)
- Vanilla approach provides excellent performance and debuggability
- Foundation is solid - ready for content expansion
- Player experience improvements have higher impact than technical refactoring

- Damage number indicators
- Combo streak displays
- Power-up pickup animations
- Improved particle effects
```

**Impact:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Significantly enhances player experience)
**Effort:** Medium

---

## üîß Phase 3: Technical Enhancements (Priority: LOW)
*Timeline: 1 week (only if needed)*

### Consider Only When:
- Project exceeds 15-20 files
- Team collaboration becomes difficult
- Performance optimization required
- Planning to reuse engine for other games

### Potential Improvements:

#### 3.1 Module System
```javascript
// ES6 modules for better organization
- Convert to import/export syntax
- Separate game engine from game content
- Create reusable component library
- Improve code splitting
```

#### 3.2 Development Tools
```javascript
// Enhanced development experience
- Vite for hot reload during development
- TypeScript for better intellisense
- ESLint for code quality
- Simple build process for optimization
```

#### 3.3 Package Management
```javascript
// Only if external dependencies needed
- npm/yarn setup
- Consider lightweight libraries:
  - Matter.js for physics (if needed)
  - Howler.js for advanced audio (if needed)
  - dat.gui for debug controls (development only)
```

**Impact:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Improves development experience)
**Effort:** High
