# PR Summary: Event-Driven Architecture Planning Documentation

## 📋 Overview

This PR contains comprehensive **planning documentation** for transforming the game's architecture from direct object manipulation to a modern event-driven system. **No implementation code is included** - this is purely documentation and planning work.

## 📚 Documentation Added

### 🗂️ New Documentation Structure
- **`docs/README.md`** - Main documentation index and navigation
- **`docs/EVENT_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md`** - Complete 3-phase implementation roadmap
- **`docs/ISSUES_SUMMARY.md`** - Summary of created GitHub issues and milestones
- **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`** - Detailed technical specifications and acceptance criteria

### 🗃️ Archive Organization
- **`docs/archive/`** - Moved old Vite migration documentation to archive

## 🎯 GitHub Issues & Milestones Created

### ✅ **3 Milestones**
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Due: Sept 1, 2025) - Core event system and state management
2. **Phase 2: Integration** (Due: Oct 15, 2025) - Entity system refactoring and optimization  
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Due: Dec 31, 2025) - Web workers, save/load, replay system

### ✅ **10 GitHub Issues** (#13-22)
Each with detailed:
- Acceptance criteria with checkboxes
- Implementation examples and code snippets
- Clear dependencies and effort estimates
- Proper labeling and milestone assignment

### ✅ **10 Custom Labels** Created
Phase-based organization with clear categorization

## 🏗️ Planned Architecture

### **Phase 1: Foundation (7-10 days)**
- Core EventDispatcher system
- State management with immutable updates
- Event-driven game loop refactor

### **Phase 2: Integration (12-18 days)**  
- Player entity event-driven conversion
- Enemy system event-driven conversion
- UI event integration
- Performance testing and optimization

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (12-16 days)**
- Web worker integration (optional)
- Save/load system implementation
- Replay system for debugging

## 📊 Total Project Scope
- **Estimated Effort**: 31-44 days (~6-9 weeks)
- **Test Coverage Requirement**: >90% throughout
- **Performance Requirement**: Maintain 60fps

## 🚀 Next Steps After Approval

1. **Review and approve** this planning documentation
2. **Create feature branch** for Issue #13 (Core Event System)
3. **Begin implementation** following the dependency chain
4. **Regular check-ins** after each epic completion

## 🔗 Key Benefits

- **Better Code Organization**: Decoupled, event-driven components
- **Easier Testing**: Isolated systems with clear interfaces
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for multiplayer, advanced features
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Optional web worker integration
