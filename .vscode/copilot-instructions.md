# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## GitHub Workflow Rules - ALWAYS FOLLOW

### Branch Management - CRITICAL RULE
- üö® **NEVER COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MASTER/MAIN** - Always create feature branches first
- ‚úÖ **COMMITS TO FEATURE BRANCHES ARE ENCOURAGED** - Commit work as it completes naturally
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS create feature/fix/enhancement branches before any development work
- ‚úÖ Pattern: `feature/story-enhancements`, `fix/powerup-bug`, `enhancement/ui-improvements`
- ‚úÖ Create branch BEFORE making any changes or commits
- ‚úÖ Only master/main should receive changes via reviewed PRs

### PR Creation
- ‚úÖ Use `gh pr create` CLI tool for ALL PRs
- ‚úÖ For large/markdown descriptions: Create temp file, use `gh pr create --body-file temp.md`, then delete temp file
- ‚úÖ Never use git commands for GitHub operations

### PR Merging  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER MERGE WITHOUT REVIEW** - PRs must be reviewed before merging
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER MERGE UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED** - Only merge when user specifically requests it
- ‚úÖ Wait for human review and approval before merging
- ‚úÖ Use `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch` for ALL merges AFTER review
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS squash merge (keeps master history clean)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS delete branch after merge
- ‚úÖ Never do local git merges
- ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot and humans should review code together

### File Cleanup
- ‚úÖ Delete temporary description files after PR creation
- ‚úÖ Commit cleanup before final operations

## Reminder: Ask "Should I use gh CLI?" before any GitHub operation
## **CRITICAL**: NEVER merge PRs without human review - where's the fire? Take time for proper review!
## **IMPORTANT**: Only merge PRs when explicitly asked by the user - don't auto-merge!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION TRACKING ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Date: 2025-07-20** - VIOLATED: Did local git merge instead of gh pr create + review process
- Consequence: Lost user trust, violated established workflow
- Commitment: Must follow copilot-instructions.md without exception
- Accountability: Any future violation means this AI assistant cannot be trusted with GitHub operations

**Date: 2025-08-22** - VIOLATED: Committed directly to master branch instead of creating feature branch first
- Consequence: Broke branch protection workflow, made changes outside of PR process
- Rule Added: Always create feature/fix/enhancement branches BEFORE any development work
- Commitment: Must create branches first, then commit, then create PR

## üîí MANDATORY CHECKS BEFORE ANY GIT/GITHUB OPERATION:
1. ‚ùì Did I read copilot-instructions.md first?
2. ‚ùì Am I on a feature branch (NOT master/main)?
3. ‚ùì For GitHub operations: Am I using gh CLI instead of git commands?
4. ‚ùì For PR merging: Did the user explicitly ask me to merge, or am I assuming?
5. ‚ùì For PR merging: Has this PR been reviewed by a human?
6. ‚ùì Am I following the exact workflow specified in the instructions?

**For regular commits to feature branches: Commit when work naturally completes!**
**If ANY GitHub operation answer is NO, STOP and ask the user for clarification.**

## Examples:

### Creating PR with large description:
```bash
# Create temp file for large description
cat > pr-description.md << 'EOF'
# Large PR Description
...
EOF

# Create PR with file
gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body-file pr-description.md

# Clean up temp file
rm pr-description.md
```

### Merging PR (ONLY AFTER HUMAN REVIEW AND EXPLICIT REQUEST):
```bash
# Wait for review first AND explicit user request to merge!
gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
```

## Never Use:
- ‚ùå `git merge`
- ‚ùå Manual GitHub UI operations
- ‚ùå Local merge commands
- ‚ùå Direct git push for PR operations
- ‚ùå **MERGING WITHOUT REVIEW** - This is the biggest mistake!
- ‚ùå **AUTO-MERGING** - Only merge when explicitly requested by user!
